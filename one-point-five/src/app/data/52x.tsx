      <p>
        To continue honing my skills across the disciplines of design,
        enginnering, and everything in between, I will be starting a practice
        where I create 52 projects in 52 weeks.
        <br />
        <br />
        From open-source software to solving short design briefs or even making
        album covers for friends, I will craft something new each week and
        reflect in a year's time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beginning on March 10. Individual website to come.
